#         We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
#         That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
#         space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
#         coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
#         sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

#     We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
#     That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
