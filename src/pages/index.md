  title: About JBC
  description: >
    JBC began as an importer and distributor of fruits from Malaysia into the
    Hong Kong market in 2016. As demand increased, JBC branched out into retail
    with several locations across the city as well as home delivery of its
    products. Since then, JBC has diversified into seafood products as well as
    non-food products internationally, becoming a bridge for customers and
    suppliers. 


    Today, JBCâ€™s team of executives with over 30 years of global sourcing and processing experience is uniquely positioned to serve the diverse needs of an international clientele in both food and non-food sectors. Each customer is unique and is focused on its own set of opportunities. With our extensive knowledge in sourcing, processing, R&D, Quality Control, and supply chain management, we work hand in hand with you to help you capitalize on, and profit from those opportunities.


    Lean, nimble and responsive, our team is ready to partner with you to help grow your business.
